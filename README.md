*Generated by ChatGPT*

![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

This is a notes-taking desktop application written in Rust. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, which are saved as Markdown files. The application offers both offline mode and stretch goals for online mode, enabling access to user's notes from multiple devices and collaboration on notes.

## Features

- Offline Mode (Minimum Viable Product)
  - The application is built using Tauri and Svelte to provide a lightweight and efficient desktop experience.
  - Users can create, edit, and delete notes.
  - Notes are saved as Markdown files on the user's local machine.

- Tags and Graph-like Visual Presentation
  - Users can add tags to their notes, facilitating easy categorization and organization.
  - Notes can be linked to each other, creating a graph-like visual representation.
  - This feature enables users to establish relationships between related notes for better context and understanding.

## Stretch Goals

- Online Mode with Axum and Svelte
  - Building on the MVP's offline functionality, the application will be extended to support online mode.
  - Online mode will allow users to access their notes from multiple devices, increasing accessibility and convenience.

- Collaboration on Notes
  - Users will be able to collaborate on notes in real-time, allowing multiple individuals to work together on the same note simultaneously.
  - Changes made by one user will be reflected in real-time to other collaborators, enhancing team productivity.
